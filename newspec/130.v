(* def tri(n):
"""Everyone knows Fibonacci sequence, it was studied deeply by mathematicians in
the last couple centuries. However, what people don't know is Tribonacci sequence.
Tribonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence:
tri(1) = 3
tri(n) = 1 + n / 2, if n is even.
tri(n) = tri(n - 1) + tri(n - 2) + tri(n + 1), if n is odd.
For example:
tri(2) = 1 + (2 / 2) = 2
tri(4) = 3
tri(3) = tri(2) + tri(1) + tri(4)
= 2 + 3 + 3 = 8
You are given a non-negative integer number n, you have to a return a list of the
first n + 1 numbers of the Tribonacci sequence.
Examples:
tri(3) = [1, 3, 2, 8]
