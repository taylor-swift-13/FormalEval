Definition eat_spec (number : Z) (need : Z) (remaining : Z) (result : list Z) : Prop :=
  (0 <= number <= 1000) /\
  (0 <= need <= 1000) /\
  (0 <= remaining <= 1000) /\
  ((need <= remaining /\ result = [number + need; remaining - need]) \/
   (need > remaining /\ result = [number + remaining; 0])).

Example eat_test_2 : eat_spec 0 800 0 [0; 0].
Proof.
  unfold eat_spec.
  repeat split; try lia.
  right.
