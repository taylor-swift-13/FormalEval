Example test_case : next_smallest_spec [-5; -90; 11; 13; 16; -3; 12; 14; 15; 15; 15] (Some (-5)).
Proof.
  unfold next_smallest_spec.
  split.
  - simpl. left. reflexivity.
  - exists (-90).
    split.
    + simpl. right. left. reflexivity.
    + split.
      * intros k Hk.
        simpl in Hk.
        repeat destruct Hk as [Hk | Hk]; subst; try lia.
      * split.
        -- lia.
        -- intros x Hx Hgt.
           simpl in Hx.
           repeat destruct Hx as [Hx | Hx]; subst; try lia.
