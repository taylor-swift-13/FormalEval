(* Definition of the precondition *)
Definition problem_159_pre (number need remaining : Z) : Prop :=
  0 <= number /\ 0 <= need /\ 0 <= remaining /\
  number <= 1000 /\ need <= 1000 /\ remaining <= 1000.

(* Definition of the specification *)
Definition problem_159_spec (number need remaining : Z) (result : list Z) : Prop :=
  (Z.ge remaining need /\ result = (number + need) :: (remaining - need) :: nil) \/
  (Z.lt remaining need /\ result = (number + remaining) :: 0 :: nil).

(* Proof for the specific test case: eat(299, 499, 300) -> [599, 0] *)
Example test_case_159: problem_159_pre 299 499 300 -> problem_159_spec 299 499 300 [599; 0].
Proof.
  (* Introduce the precondition hypothesis *)
  intros Hpre.
  
  (* Unfold the specification to expose the logic *)
  unfold problem_159_spec.
  
  (* Since remaining (300) < need (499), we must prove the right side of the disjunction *)
  right.
  
  (* Split the conjunction into the condition check and the result calculation *)
  split.
  - (* Subgoal 1: Prove 300 < 499 *)
    lia.
  - (* Subgoal 2: Prove [599; 0] matches the calculation [299 + 300; 0] *)
    (* Simplify the arithmetic expressions in the list *)
    simpl.
    (* Prove equality *)
    reflexivity.
