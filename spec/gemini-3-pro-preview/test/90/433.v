Definition next_smallest_spec (lst : list Z) (res : option Z) : Prop :=
  match res with
  | None => 
      forall x y, In x lst -> In y lst -> x = y
  | Some z => 
      In z lst /\
      exists m,

Example test_case : next_smallest_spec [1; 2; 3; 3; 5; -7; 7; 9; 10; -2; -3; -4; -5; -8; -6; -7; -8; -10; 2; -8; -9; 3; 1] (Some (-9)).
Proof.
  unfold next_smallest_spec.
  split.
  - simpl. do 20 right. left. reflexivity.
  - exists (-10).
    split.
    + simpl. do 17 right. left. reflexivity.
    + split.
      * intros k Hk.
        simpl in Hk.
        repeat destruct Hk as [Hk | Hk]; subst; try lia.
      * split.
        -- lia.
        -- intros x Hx Hgt.
           simpl in Hx.
