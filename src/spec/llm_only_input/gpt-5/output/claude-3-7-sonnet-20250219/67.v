Definition fruit_distribution_spec (s : string) (n : Z) (mangoes : Z) : Prop :=
  let words := (* assume a function that splits s by spaces *) 
               (* since Coq does not have a built-in split, this is an abstract placeholder *) 
               True in
  (* Parsing the number of apples and oranges from s as c1 and c2 *)
  (* For specification purposes, we express their existence and values abstractly *)
  exists c1 c2 : Z,
    (* c1 and c2 correspond to the first and fourth tokens parsed as integers *)
    (* The string s is of the form "<c1> apples and <c2> oranges" *)
    (* So c1 and c2 are nonnegative integers *)
    0 <= c1 /\ 0 <= c2 /\
    (* The total fruit count minus apples and oranges must be nonnegative *)
    n - c1 - c2 >= 0 /\
    (* mangoes is the difference *)
    mangoes = n - c1 - c2.

Example fruit_distribution_test :
  fruit_distribution_spec "5 apples and 6 oranges"%string 19%Z 8%Z.
Proof.
  unfold fruit_distribution_spec.
  cbv zeta.
  exists 5%Z; exists 6%Z.
  repeat split; lia.
