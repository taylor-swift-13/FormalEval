Example test_case : next_smallest_spec [5; 3; 7; 8; -1; 5; -6; 0; 9; -1; -10; -10; -80] (Some (-10)).
Proof.
  unfold next_smallest_spec.
  split.
  - simpl. do 10 right. left. reflexivity.
  - exists (-80).
    split.
    + simpl. do 12 right. left. reflexivity.
    + split.
      * intros k Hk.
        simpl in Hk.
        repeat destruct Hk as [Hk | Hk]; subst; try lia.
      * split.
        -- lia.

           simpl in Hx.
