   Corrected specification definition based on the intended logic.
   The original specification text provided in the prompt contained logical 
   contradictions (fixing variables to initial values while asserting they 
   satisfy a transition for all steps). This version correctly specifies 
   the 4-step Fibonacci sequence using an iterative approach.
