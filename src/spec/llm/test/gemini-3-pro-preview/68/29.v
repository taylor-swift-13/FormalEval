Definition pluck (arr : list Z) : list Z :=
  let fix aux (l : list Z) (idx : Z) (best : option (Z * Z)) : option (Z * Z) :=

    | x :: xs =>
      if Z.even x then
        match best with
        | None => aux xs (idx + 1) (Some (x, idx))
        | Some (v, i) =>
          if x <? v then aux xs (idx + 1) (Some (x, idx))
