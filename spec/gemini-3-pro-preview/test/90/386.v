Example test_case : next_smallest_spec [11; 15; 13; 16; 12; 10; 15; 13; -51; 15; 16] (Some 10).
Proof.
  unfold next_smallest_spec.
  split.
  - simpl. do 5 right. left. reflexivity.
  - exists (-51).
    split.
    + simpl. do 8 right. left. reflexivity.
    + split.
      * intros k Hk.
        simpl in Hk.
        repeat destruct Hk as [Hk | Hk]; subst; try lia.
      * split.
        -- lia.
        -- intros x Hx Hgt.
           simpl in Hx.
           repeat destruct Hx as [Hx | Hx]; subst; try lia.
