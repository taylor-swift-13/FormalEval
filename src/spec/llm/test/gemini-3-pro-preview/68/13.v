Definition pluck (arr : list Z) : list Z :=
  let fix aux (l : list Z) (idx : Z) (acc : option (Z * Z)) : option (Z * Z) :=
    match l with
    | [] => acc
    | x :: xs =>
      if Z.even x then
        match acc with
        | None => aux xs (idx + 1) (Some (x, idx))
        | Some (mv, mi) =>
          if x <? mv then aux xs (idx + 1) (Some (x, idx))
          else aux xs (idx + 1) acc
        end
      else aux xs (idx + 1) acc
